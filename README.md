### Objective:
The objective of the **LibraryManagementApp** is to provide an efficient and user-friendly system for managing library resources, facilitating operations such as adding, checking out, returning items, and managing overdue fines. It aims to enhance the overall library experience for both librarians and patrons by streamlining resource management and improving accessibility.

### Key Activities:
1. **Item Management**:
   - Adding new books, magazines, and DVDs to the library collection.
   - Editing and deleting existing items.

2. **User Operations**:
   - Checking out library items by patrons.
   - Returning items and calculating overdue fines if applicable.

3. **Search Functionality**:
   - Allowing users to search for items by title, author, or category.

4. **Data Persistence**:
   - Saving and loading library data from a file (`library.dat`) to ensure information is retained across sessions.

5. **User Roles Management**:
   - Providing different functionalities for librarians and patrons.

### Technologies Used:
1. **Programming Language**: Java
2. **File Handling**: Java I/O for data persistence (using `ObjectOutputStream` and `ObjectInputStream` for serialization).
3. **Data Structures**: Collections such as ArrayList to store library items.
4. **User Interface**: Console-based text interface for user interaction. 

This combination of objectives, activities, and technologies creates a robust system for managing library resources effectively.
